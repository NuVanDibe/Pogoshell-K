HOW TO BUILD libpogo AND PogoShell

o Get DevKitAdvance, either the the real archive or my minimal version
  (enough to compile libpogo, pogoshell and other libpogo based apps).

o Unpack devkitaddv and add devkitadv\bin to your path

o From the pogodist root directory, type "make". This should build
  libpogo and pogoshell. If you don't have the compiled tools in
  the tools directory, it will try to build this with Visual C++ which
  will fail if you don't have VC set up for commandline compilation
  (with CL.EXE). That's why I include the EXE:s in the source
  distribution.

o Type "make distro" to make the PogoShell directory with the
  necesary files to build & test a pogoshell rom. Now you should be
  able to run PogoShell as normal.



HOW LIBFLASHCART WORKS

In the beginning of shell2\Makefile you will find a line
specifying which flashcart library to use when building pogoshell,
like so:
  
LIBFCLASHCART = ../libfc_visoly_xg1/libflashcart.a

You can change this line to build a pogoshell version for another
flashcart that you have a library for.

(NOTE: When compiling pogoshell with libfc_xrom for XRom support,
 remember to call MAKEFS with the "-x" flag to force the filesystem
 to pad all romstarts to even 128KByte boundries!!)

If you want to support a new flashcart, take a look at the the
source for the already provided libraries and change it to your
liking.
