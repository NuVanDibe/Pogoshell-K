# Pogoshell-K
A long while ago, a GBATemp member named Kuwanger picked up work on a then-abandoned project called Pogoshell, by sasq. After some great improvements, development once again stalled.

Tragically, Kuwanger passed away in 2019, and his site went down. [Thankfully it was crawled by Internet Archive's WayBack Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150430211142/http://kuwanger.net/gba/pogoshell/archive/), so we can go back and pick up the source.

This will be a slow project to evolve and it's possible that no further improvements to Pogoshell may ever be made. But, feel free to fork as you wish.
