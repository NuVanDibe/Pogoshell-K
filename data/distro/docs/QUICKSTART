QUICKSTART
----------

* If you have an XRom-cart, copy the PogoShell/xrom/*.* on top of the files
  in PogoShell/ (This replaces Pogo.gba and build.bat with XRom specific
  version. Also note that TEST doesn't currently work for XRom).

* Double click BUILD.BAT to generate the rom you need

* Double click TEST.BAT to try out PogoShell in an emulator (Not on XRom)

* When you feel comfortable, copy some games/roms/texts to the "root" folder

* Run BUILD.BAT and TEST.BAT again. If everything works...

* Start your Flasher software and write FLASHME.GBA to your flash cart.
  Note that you should _turn_off_ writing of the menu if the flasher normally
  adds one. Pogoshell needs to be the first rom on the cart to work fully.
